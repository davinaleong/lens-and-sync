# Implementation Log

Running log of real business-logic implementation, following the
implement → document → update checklists → commit/push cycle. Each entry
is one commit. See `05-progress.md` for the scaffolding baseline and
`06-toolchain-decisions.md` for vendor choices this builds on.

## 2026-07-22 — Cycle 1: `shared-config` env loader

**What:** `packages/shared-config/src/env.ts` now exports a real
`loadEnv(schema, source?)` — parses `process.env` (or an injected source,
for testing) against a Zod schema, and throws one readable error listing
every missing/invalid key if validation fails. Also exports two small
reusable pieces: `commaSeparated` (splits `"a, b, c"` into `["a","b","c"]`,
used for `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` and `GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_IDS`) and shared
`nodeEnvSchema`/`logLevelSchema` enums so both apps validate those the
same way.

**Why this first:** every other implementation cycle needs config that's
validated *before* the app tries to use it — better to crash immediately
with "JWT_ACCESS_SECRET is missing" than fail confusingly three requests
later. It also directly extends the `pnpm run env:check` scripts added
last session: `env:check` verifies presence at the shell level, `loadEnv`
verifies shape/type at process startup.

**Tests:** `packages/shared-config/tests/env.test.ts` — 5 cases (defaults
applied, values coerced/overridden, multi-field error message, comma-split
edge cases). All passing. `pnpm run typecheck` and `pnpm run build` pass
clean across all 9 workspace packages.

**Not done yet:** not wired into either app yet — that's Cycle 2.

## 2026-07-22 — Cycle 2: wire config, CORS, and rate limiting into both apps

**What:** Each app now has `src/config.ts` — a Zod schema matching its
`.env.example` exactly, parsed once via `loadEnv()` at import time. Both
`index.ts` files import `config` instead of reading `process.env`
directly, and now run real middleware that was previously just
`.env.example` placeholders:

- `cors({ origin: config.CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS })` — explicit allowlist,
  not `*` (`01-security-checklist.md` §2).
- `express-rate-limit` backed by `rate-limit-redis`, using a shared
  `ioredis` client (`01-security-checklist.md` §8). New files:
  `apps/dish-lens/src/session/redis-client.ts` (was a stub) and
  `apps/drive-sync/src/redis-client.ts` (new — also earmarked for BullMQ
  job locking later).

**Gotchas hit:** `ioredis`'s default export isn't constructable under
this project's `NodeNext`/`isolatedModules` TS config — fixed by using
the named `{ Redis }` export instead. `rate-limit-redis`'s `sendCommand`
type doesn't accept a plain spread of `ioredis.call(...args)` because
`call` is overloaded (TS can't resolve which overload against a
non-tuple spread) — fixed by passing the command as a positional arg and
spreading only the rest, then casting the return to `Promise<RedisReply>`.

**Verified live** (not just typecheck/build): started a temporary local
Redis, ran both compiled apps with their real `.env` files. `/health` on
both returns `200` with `RateLimit-*` response headers proving requests
are actually being counted through Redis, not an in-memory stub. Also
confirmed the fail-fast path: running `drive-sync` with an empty
environment crashes immediately with `Invalid environment
configuration: - CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS: Required` instead of starting
broken. Redis was shut down again afterward — no persistent process left
running.

**Not done yet:** `helmet()` config is still defaults (no custom CSP).
JWT verification middleware itself (`shared-auth`) is still a stub — config
validates the secrets exist, but nothing checks a token yet.
